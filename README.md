My name is Colin Marett. I'm currently enrolled at the University of Kansas pursuing a Master's in 
Computer Engineering. I am proficient in Python, C/C++ and slightly proficient with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I have spent a number of hours on embedded systems and FPGAs, trying to make micro-radar systems and communication systems.
My main interest is in cryptography and cybersecurity because there is a large interlap with mathematics and coding. 
I'm open to any project ideas. You can contact me at crmarett@ku.edu.
