My name is Colin Marett. I'm currently enrolled at the University of Kansas double majoring in 
Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am proficient in Python and currently learning SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
My main interest is in cryptography and cybersecurity because there is a large interlap with mathematics and coding. 
I'm open to any project ideas. You can contact me at crmarett@gmail.com or crmarett@ku.edu.
